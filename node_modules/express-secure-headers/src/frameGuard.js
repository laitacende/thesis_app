| Click Jacking Attack
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack", is when an attacker
| uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking
| on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on
| the the top level page. Thus, the attacker is "hijacking" clicks meant for
| their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another
| application, domain, or both.

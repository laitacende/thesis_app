/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| XSS Attack
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Cross site scripting (XSS) is a common attack vector that injects malicious
| code into a vulnerable web application. XSS differs from other web attack
| vectors (e.g., SQL injections), in that it does not directly target the
| application itself. Instead, the users of the web application are the ones
| at risk.
| Depending on the severity of the attack, user accounts may be compromised,
| Trojan horse programs activated and page content modified, misleading users
| into willingly surrendering their private data. Finally, session cookies
| could be revealed, enabling a perpetrator to impersonate valid users and
| abuse their private accounts.

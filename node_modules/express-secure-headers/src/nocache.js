| Cache Control Attack
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Cache-control is an HTTP header that dictates browser caching behavior.
| In a nutshell, when someone visits a website, their browser will save certain
| resources, such as images and website data, in a store called the cache.
| When that user revisits the same website, cache-control sets the rules which
| determine whether that user will have those resources loaded from their local
| cache, or whether the browser will have to send a request to the server for
| fresh resources. In order to understand cache-control in greater depth,
| a basic understanding of browser caching and HTTP headers is required.
